1. Explain how to build stateful class components.

First you will need to make an export a class and extend component from React

 ex. export default class app extends React.Component{}

 within that you will need to plug in a constructor and super ex. constructor{ super()}

 within constructo is where you declare your state with this.state.

 after that you need a render and return ex render(){return()}.

2. Describe the different phases of the component lifecycle.

Mounting where the component is initially created.

Updating when the state changes it will get re-rendered. Becareful during this part

because if you are not careful you can create and infinite loop.

UnMounting component gets deleted and cleared out.

3. Demonstrate an understanding of class component lifecycle methods.

the lifecycle starts with componentdidmount this is where you do your axios calls

then it moves onto componentdidupdate this will update the state if it is changing from the componentdidmount

after that componentwillunmount is called this is where the component goes to die.

4. Define stateful logic. Stateful logic is code that uses state. The use of state
makes code reusable.

5. Describe how to test a React component with React Testing Library.

First you will need to install a testing library we are using Jest now.

you will then need to add the test script.

start the test script

at something we can test

after that you create a test js file ex checkoutform.test.js.

import the file you want to use

you will need to import components from @testing-library/react.
